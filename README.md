# VSO Extension - Folder Management

### What
Easily and quickly create new folders in Code Explorer through the Web Access for TFVC and Git.

### Why
Previously you could only create new files from web access. To add a folder, you would need to use your local Git or TFVC repository. This meant that people who arenâ€™t comfortable using Git or Visual Studio, could not add a folder. This extension helps solve that problem.
