# VSO Extension - Folder Management

### What
Easily and quickly create new folders in Code Explorer through the Web Access for TFVC and Git.

### Why
Previously you could only create new files from web access. To add a folder, you would need to use your local Git or TFVC repository. This meant that people who arenâ€™t comfortable using Git or Visual Studio, could not add a folder. This extension helps solve that problem.

### Steps
1. Clone this repo
2. Browse to the folder of the extension
3. Publish the contents of the extension to a local or cloud web server
4. The root of the extension should be at the root of the web server, for example: https://myserver/images/fabrikam-logo.png
5. Update the extension manifest file (extension.json). To do this, update the  namespace field to a globally unique value. For example: johnsmith.samples.foldermanagement. Also, update the  baseUri  field to be the fully qualified URL to the root of your web server, for example:  https://myserver 
8. Install the extension into your Visual Studio Online account (see https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/integrate/extensions/publish/overview)
